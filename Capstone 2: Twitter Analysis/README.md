# Springboard Capstone 2: Twitter Analysis

## Objective
Twitter Classification – gather twitter data from two similar groups of users with a clear identifiable keyword in their profile, specifically “Students” and “Teachers.” Then create an Natural Language Processing prediction model that attempts to identify them based on tweet text.

## Data

Source of the Data and Method of Acquirement
https://twitter.com/\n
https://followerwonk.com/\n
https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python/blob/master/LICENSE\n
The data was scraped and collected from followerwonk and Twitter with some code taken from the github link above.
The data gathered includes the 1000 usernames with either the keyword “student” or “teacher” in their profile (500 each). The other search parameter used was to have a follower range between 500-600, … , 1400-1500 so that a more diverse sample set with enough credibility could be collected.

## Methods for analysis

* Programming in python
* Data wrangling
* Data visualization
* Statistical Inference
* Applied machine learning

### Capstone Project

The Capstone project allows the student to work a problem end-to-end : Defining the question, formulating a hypothesis, obtaining, cleaning, and visualizing the data necessary to test the hypothesis, and clearly presenting the findings.
