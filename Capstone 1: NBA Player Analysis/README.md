# Springboard Capstone 1: NBA Player Analysis

## Objective
The objective of my project is to create a model that predicts the RPM (real-plus-minus) of an NBA player based on their individual stats.

RPM is a player's estimated on-court impact on team performance, measured in net point differential per 100 offensive and defensive possessions. RPM takes into account teammates, opponents and additional factors.

## Data

The data was aquired from Basketball-Reference.com and espn.com.
RPM stats are provided by Jeremias Engelmann in consultation with Steve Ilardi.
RPM is based on Engelmann's xRAPM (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus). Play-by-play data provided by Basketball-Reference.com.

### Capstone Project

The Capstone project allows the student to work a problem end-to-end : Defining the question, formulating a hypothesis, obtaining, cleaning, and visualizing the data necessary to test the hypothesis, and clearly presenting the findings.
